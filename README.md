# Snowflake Table Comparison Tool

This repository helps you compare two Snowflake tables by:

- Checking for column mismatches (present in one table but not the other)
- Comparing the **count of distinct values** for columns present in both tables
- Logging all results to a timestamped log file
- Works with Snowflake **SSO (external browser)** authentication

## üß± Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `compare_tables.py` | Command-line script to compare two tables |
| `compare_tables.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook version for interactive exploration |
| `example_config.json` | Sample configuration file for Snowflake connection |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

You need Python 3 and the Snowflake connector installed:

```bash
pip install snowflake-connector-python
```

### 2. Create Your Config File  
Make a copy of `example_config.json` and name it `config.json`:

```json
{
  "account": "YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT",
  "user": "YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USER",
  "warehouse": "YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_WARESHOUSE"
}
```
Replace the values with your actual Snowflake credentials.  
**Note:** This script uses externalbrowser authentication (SSO), so no password is required.

## üìù Output

A log file is created automatically, named like:

```
compare_log_2025-06-23_14-30-00.txt
```

It includes:

- Column mismatches
- Distinct value differences
- Summary of matching columns

---

## üßº Excluded Columns

You can customize which columns to exclude from comparison:

```python
EXCLUDED_COLUMNS = ['_FIVETRAN_SYNCED', '_MODIFIED', ...]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Access to Snowflake via externalbrowser (SSO)
- Necessary privileges to read metadata and query both tables
